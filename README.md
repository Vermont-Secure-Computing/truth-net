# truth-net
Distributed Truth Network, No Cap.
Truth-net is a simple tokenless binary oracle on the Solana network.  

Earn money as a truth provider ...  
....  or use this network to provide truth about real world events for your smart contracts.   


Truth providers:  

    Deposit 1/2 a Solana to join the network.  Your deposit is redeemable any time you choose to leave the network.  
    You can rejoin the network at any time.  This is to prevent Sybil attacks.  

    Select an event from the list in the Commit stage, and submit your vote with a password.  
    During the reveal stage, enter your password and reveal your vote to the network.  
    Collect your reward if you voted with the consensus.

    Increase your reputation by revealing votes and voting with the consensus.
    Your reputation is a multiplier which multiplies your voice and your reward.  

Smart Contract Developers:  

    Events can be added to the network any time using the front end here (by hand) or programatically (see e.g. solbetx.com).
    Rewards to the network participants for an event can be added at any time by sending solana to the event program ID.
